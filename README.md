# House-Pricing-Dataset

# üè° House Pricing Dataset Analysis using Python and EDA

This project explores the **Ames Housing Dataset** using **Python** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The goal is to identify key drivers of house prices and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

## üìÇ Dataset

We use the [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) from Kaggle, which contains comprehensive information on residential home sales in Ames, Iowa.

## üìä EDA Process Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Inspection
- Overview of features and target variable
- Checked for nulls and incorrect types

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values
- Imputed missing values using domain logic
- Dropped irrelevant or high-null columns

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of `SalePrice`, `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`, etc.
- Count plots for `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, etc.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Scatter plots between `SalePrice` and numerical features
- Groupby stats for categorical features

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Outlier Detection
- Boxplots and IQR-based filtering
- Visual inspection of `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- New features like `TotalBathrooms`, `HouseAge`
- Log transformation of skewed columns

## üìà Key Insights

- High-quality construction (`OverallQual`) greatly influences price.
- `GrLivArea` and `GarageCars` are strong positive predictors.
- Location (`Neighborhood`) is a significant factor.
- Some features require normalization before modeling.
